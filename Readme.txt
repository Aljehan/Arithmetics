Suhaib Aljehani 9990823

This is a new implementation of both N and L algorithms it doesn't require as much calculation nor a lot of string building operation. 

Note that this algorithms for N and L is inspired by my classmate Chenrong Lu and it is not a copy of his work.
to run:


Compile the code with

javac Arithmetics2.java

then use

java Arithmetics2  < test.txt
